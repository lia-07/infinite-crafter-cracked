# Infinite Crafter Cracked

This project uses the API used in the Infinite Miner game on the [neal.fun](https://neal.fun/) website in order to craft two items of _your_ choosing. May be buggy, I'm not going to maintain this much.

## Setup

1. You need [Python3](https://www.python.org/) and [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) installed.
2. Clone this repo or copy and paste `craft.py`
3. Run `python3 craft.py` in the project directory and blend items together to your heart's content!
